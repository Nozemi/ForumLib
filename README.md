# ForumLib
This is so far a basic core of a framework/library for a forum software.
The goal is to write a OOP forum software from scratch.
Why? Because I can, and it's a fun experience. This is under heavily development,
and is nowhere near completed. Later on I'll add a changelog, but for now,
the commit history will have to suffice for that purpose.

There's some documentation, but not a lot. If you know PHP,
feel free to use the code for whatever you wish.

### Functionality
As far as functionality goes. I'll probably keep it simplistic and easy to use.
There're already more advanced alternatives out there, like MyBB or IPB.
