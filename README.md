# ForumLib
Currently not much to say. This is so far just the very basic core of a framework. The goal is to write a OOP forum software from scratch. Why? Because I can, and it's a fun experience.

## Functionality
As far as functionality goes. I'll probably keep it simplistic and easy to use. There are already more advanced alternatives out there, like MyBB or IPB.
